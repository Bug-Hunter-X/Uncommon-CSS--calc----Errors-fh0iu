The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a `width` property of an element that is a child of another element with `width: 100%` can lead to unexpected results because the `100%` refers to the parent's width, not the viewport.  Another example is incorrect operator usage: `calc(10px + 10%)` is valid but `calc(10px + 10% + 20)` isn't (missing operator between 10% and 20). Mixing units inconsistently (e.g., `calc(10px + 10em)` is fine, but `calc(10px + 10%)` can have different interpretations across browsers).  Also, forgetting to include units in calc (e.g. `calc(10 + 10)`) will result in an error.
